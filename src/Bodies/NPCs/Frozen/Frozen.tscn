Player: Hey! 

Frozen: I see you have a costume there. 

Frozen: One I happen to need in order to star in my next homemade movie. 

Player: Well… Do you want it? You can have it actually. 

Frozen: I’m on a “helping people” vibe. Trying to find a home. 

Frozen: HA! Well, sorry but my home is for my art only. 

Frozen: What better place for keeping your masterpieces 

Frozen: if not the temple that is your own haven, isn’t that true~? 

Frozen: But I can give you this, if it fits your taste. 

Player: Oh… thank you. 

Frozen: Quit the sad face, dear. Soon enough you’ll find a place to call your own. 

Frozen: Now, I need something to film aerial footage. Ugh, where did that thing go…

Frozen: I’ve been looking for this for days! 

Player: It was just by your neighbor’s backyard. 

Frozen: Oh, that ridiculous man. Making shows everywhere, not valuing his own art. 

Frozen: I would never get close to his backyard. I’m glad I had you to do this for me. 

Player: Oh, sure. I didn’t know you weren’t fond of the guy, though.

Frozen: I’m certainly not. So thank you for that. 

Frozen: Take this mask. It’s an original piece I made for one of my biggest plays. 

Player: I’m sure I’ll put it to good use. 

Frozen: Ha! Now, to start filming!!
