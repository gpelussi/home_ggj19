Penguin: Man, you saved mah life! I'm no good at math stuff at all. 

Penguin: I needed this for the restaurant bills and such. 

Penguin: That dude, I hope he's getting enough money to go home and see his daughters, yo.

Penguin: Bought the calculator to help him. 

Player: Oh... The merchant Beetle? What’s up with his daughters though?

Penguin: Dude haven’t got much time to see’em lately ‘cause of work. 

Penguin: Sad, right? By the way... if you happen to find a katana somewhere, 

Penguin: I can give you something in return for it. 

Player: Sure! And I’m looking for a home, if you could help me.

Penguin: Then you’re invited to come and eat here in my simple restaurant someday, yo. 

Penguin: Best way to feel like home is by tasting its flavor. But yea, anyways, tell Beetle I sent hello.

Player: It’s yours. Have fun with your sushi now! 

Penguin: Maaan, the show I’m gonna put on cutting sushi with this new babe. 

Penguin: Oh! Have this. Its the finest fish there ever was. 

Player: Oh! Really?

Penguin: They’re known for their unique flavor

Penguin: one that makes everyone remember home.  My fave ingredient.

Player: Cool… I might have just the use for it. 

Player: Hey! Can I maybe… take one of those flowers you have around? 

Penguin: Flowers? Wha- Oh. Oh, sure. These aren’t even mine to keep, bro.
