Player: Hide? Hide what?

Fox: If I’m hiding, it means it’s a secret. 

Player: Fine. Have it. I won’t use it anyway. 

Fox: Hehe! Thank you. 

Fox: You know, those idiots who hurt innocent people to take their homes… 

Fox: they deserve hell, you know. 

Player: … right. 

Fox: I spend my day here, caring for those they leave wounded… I just can’t stand it. They all must pay. And I’m gonna make them pay. 

Player: Sure. Well… aren’t you gonna give me anything? 

Fox: Why would I?

Player. I-I don’t know. It’s been happening. 

Fox: Um, well, you can take this. I don’t use it. It’s just for the looks. Now… to dissolve the corpses...

Player: But aren’t you a doc-... Nevermind.

Fox: Is this Kal? Really? It’s exactly what I needed. 

Player: Yeah… Tell me something (god, I might regret this), 

Player: but are you killing people in here?

Fox: I’m a hunter killer. 

Fox: I despise the ones who think they have any power over other folk’s territory. 

Fox: I treat the wounds of the hunted and wound the hunters to their death. 

Player: Aren’t you afraid? 

Fox: Of defending my people? Fighting for a cause? No. 

Fox: We all must protect our home, our haven. 

Fox: We must be brave enough to fight for such a valuable thing. 

Player: I see.

Fox: Could you find a home for yourself? 

Player: What? I never told you I was looking for one.

Fox: News go fast around here. That’s why this Kal’s gonna be useful. 

Fox: But hey, don’t give up. You just gotta look in a different way. 

Player: Oh, thanks. That was actually really kind of you.

Fox: But now get rid of this for me. I’m out! 

Player: WAIT-!
