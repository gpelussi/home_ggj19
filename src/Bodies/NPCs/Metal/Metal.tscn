Player: Yes. It’s a stethoscope.

Metal: Yea! A stocoscope, this thingy.

Metal: A home?! Well, I happen to build homes! 

Metal: We can talk after I become a famous rock star, then I’ll build you a house as well!

Metal: I will take it, yes!! You know, 

Metal: bet thing about building houses to people is their gratitude. 

Metal: A lot of clients of mine come to my shows as a thank you for making their homes. 

Metal: Gratitude. Thank you, seriously.

Player: Hey, no problem. 

Metal: This tech-thingy fell in my backyard ‘couple days ago. 

Metal: Here. Have it as my gratitude. 

Metal: I don’t even know what it is but maybe it’s valuable.
 
Player: Oh god. I think I know who this belongs to.
