Player: What? The mirror?

Samurai: Yes. It’s exactly the one my beloved Yuki adored...

Samurai: when she was still here among us. 

Player: Here. Take it.

Samurai: Are you sure, child? 

Player: Yes. It must be special to you. 

Samurai: Memories are the closest thing you have of a home. 

Samurai: It is just like Yuki’s garden. My best memories of her are there.

Player: It’s okay! You can keep it, its just a sh-

Samurai: Take. It.
